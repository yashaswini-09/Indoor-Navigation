# Indoor-Navigation-System

This project is an **interactive indoor navigation system** built in Python using **NetworkX, Matplotlib, and ipywidgets**.  
It allows you to simulate **step-by-step movement** between rooms and staircases inside a building.

## 🚀 Features
- Define a **graph-based floor map** with rooms and stair nodes.
- Select **Source** and **Destination** from dropdown menus.
- Compute **shortest path** automatically using NetworkX.
- Visualize:
  - **Normal nodes** → Blue
  - **Stairs** → Green
  - **Visited nodes** → Dark Green
  - **Current position** → Dark Blue
  - **Destination** → Red
- Step-by-step **movement tracking** with "Next Step" button.
- Displays **full path** once the destination is reached.

## 📷 Demo
1. Choose a source and destination node.
2. Click **Start Tracking** → shortest path is calculated.
3. Use **Next Step** to move along the path interactively.
4. The graph updates live showing your progress.
